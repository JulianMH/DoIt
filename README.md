I do no longer have time to update and keep developing this app, but I will update it in the store if someone contributes to this project on github.

Make sure you install the LiveSDK to be able to compile the source code:

## Contributing

If you want to add features, feel to do so and submit a pull request. Or you can just fork it and build your own timetable app.

No idea where to start? Here are some things that could be done:

- fix server connection problems
- windows 10 compatibility (ideally as universal app)
- nice UI for bigger screens
- remove all german comments in the code or translate them to english
